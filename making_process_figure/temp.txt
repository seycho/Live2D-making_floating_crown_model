It can make 3d shape's similar texture by using one or two panel.
But actually basic system of Live2d is 2D visual production.
For this reason, it is difficult to represent shadow or reflection effect by overlapping the clipping mask texture on the model texture.
if directly deform model panel for rotating production, the clipping mask is 
subjected each basic model texture, so it will be seen at once that frontward and backward in viewpoint.
It appear in figure X.
To make shadow and reflection effect using clipping mask on the each frontward and backward, set the front and back texture which can extend or shrink according to angle value.
